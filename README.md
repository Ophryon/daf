# Dual-feature Adaptive Framework for Multi-modal Disinformation Detection

The dataset was created based on gossipcop dataset from [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet) and weibo dataset from [EANN](https://github.com/yaqingwang/EANN-KDD18). Images are identical to the original datasets.
